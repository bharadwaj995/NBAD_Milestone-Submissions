    <p>As a travel photographer, I am on the road a lot and, therefore, do not always have internet access so I may take a few days to reply. I prioritize client and business-related emails over the rest of the emails in my inbox, but I do my very best to reply to everyone.</p>
    <p>Thanks for understanding!</p>
