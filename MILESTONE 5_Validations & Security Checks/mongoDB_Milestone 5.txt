It is remarkable, the photographic challenges they digitally solve in an instant to capture beautiful images. To use your camera to its full capability you’ve got to be familiar with its functions. Unfortunately, this means you’ll have to read (then re-read- repeat many times) the manual! These articles are intended to replace the technical aspects of a user’s manual. Each article contains at least one sentence as to when to use that particular function.,', dateAndTime:'24th February, 2020 10:00 AM', hostedBy:'Bharadwaj',venue:'Times Square, New York city, NY',image:'../assets/images/kycam.jpg'},

Read brochures and travel books. Go to libraries, bookstores, or onto the Web. Talk to friends who have been there. Pick up travel information at the country\'s embassy. Find whatever you can that is relevant, and devour it. Understanding the customs and traditions of a place is vital. For one thing, you want to be sure you act in a way that is not rude or offensive while you are there, and it\'s hard to know what\'s acceptable and what isn\'t with some knowledge. It can also help you understand things people do that at first encounter you might consider incomprehensible or even horrifying.' ,dateAndTime:'24th February, 2020 10:00 AM',hostedBy:'Sachin',venue: 'Hudson yards, New York City, NY',image:'../assets/images/kyplace.jpg'},

When in doubt, make sure you\'re using the rule of thirds to set up your photo.When framing a photo, imagine the scene divided up as above. Think about what elements of the photo are most important, and try to position them at or near the lines and intersections of the grid. They don\'t have to be perfectly lined up as long as they\'re close.For landscpaes: place it along one of the horizontal line.For Vertical Subjects: split a photo in two, in much the same way as a horizon can do horizontally. To avoid this, position them off-centre in your composition</li>',dateAndTime:'26th February, 2020 10:00 AM',hostedBy:'Vettel',venue:'Brooklyn Bridge, New York City, NY',image:'../assets/images/twothirdrule.jpg'},

    {userID:"Steve McCurry and Bharadwaj Arya",connectionId:08, connection_category:'LEARN BASIC POST-PROCESSING TIPS',connection_name:'ADJUST THE HORIZON',details:'It is easier to fix the horizon because we can make sure the horizon is straight before we take the image with our camera. Some tripod comes with an inbuilt fluid level that you can use to make sure the horizon is straight. You can also get a fluid level mount to the hot shoe of your camera. These are relatively cheap on the internet. It is a bit more challenging to control for perspective. For example, when photographing architecture, unless you are high up above the ground, the building is going to be tilted. This is because we often shoot from the ground with our camera tilted upwards to include the whole building into the frame. For those who are serious about architectural photography, you consider getting a tilt-shift lens for that purpose.',dateAndTime:'28th February, 2020 10:00 AM',hostedBy:'Murray',venue:'Manhattan Centre, New York City, NY',image:'../assets/images/adjusthorizon.jpg'},
    {userID:"Steve McCurry and Bharadwaj Arya",connectionId:09, connection_category:'LEARN BASIC POST-PROCESSING TIPS',connection_name:'ADJUST THE EXPOSURE AND THE CONTRAST',details:'After you have straightened the horizon and removed any unwanted or distracting elements from the frame, next adjust the exposure of the image. This adjusts the brightness. If the image is too dark, add light in and if the image is too bright, reduce light. Keep in mind that often times adjusting brightness will affect the contrast of the image as well. This can be fixed by adjusting the Contrast Slider in Lightroom. It makes the brightest parts of the image brighter and the darkest parts darker, and improves the overall look of the adjusted image.',dateAndTime:'28th February, 2020 10:00 AM',hostedBy:'Murray',venue:'Manhattan Centre, New York City, NY',image:'../assets/images/expcontrast.jpg'}
