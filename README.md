Please follow the below link to view the web application deployed in Google Cloud's App Engine. Google App Engine is a platform for building scalable web applications and mobile backends. Just upload your code and Google will manage your app's availability. There are no servers for you to provision or maintain.

App Engine provides you with built-in services and APIs such as a NoSQL database, memcache, and a user authentication API, common to most web and mobile applications. It will scale your application automatically in response to the amount of traffic it receives so you only pay for the resources you use, from zero to millions of users. With built-in services such as load balancing, health checks, and application logging, you can deploy web and mobile applications much faster
